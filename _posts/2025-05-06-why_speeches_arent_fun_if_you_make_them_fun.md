"Why speeches aren't funny if you try to make them funny"

If the goal when writing a speech is to make it funny it will always fail.
Humour relies on subject-matter, which in order to be presented well - relies on not just _"knowledge"_, but multiple _"knowledges"_ - also known as multiple perspectives or multiple schools of thought.
When you know why people know something and why others may not, why you may think you know something when in fact you do not, and why the actual information you're giving is the real gift, not the joke - then you can start.

Anyone can be funny provided they know enough about the source material. Someone who spent their whole life studying the cell structure of the larvae of Tasmanian bot-flies, probably knows the funniest joke there is to tell on the topic. The only problem is nobody else knows enough to get it...

Also, if you have to make it obvious it's funny - that means it's not. Things should seem funny "by accident", the person making the joke is the victim, the lower person, not the one telling others to laugh.

Finally, laughter is a sign of trust - as it shows you're letting down your guard and are being defenseless. People will laugh much more if they feel safe, so start by building trust and integrity before thinking about trying to control the crowd.

**How to do this ?**

1. Start with a good speech ( This isn't supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be informative )
2. Make sure you understand everything that is being relayed, and make sure it's in the language you would use if you were trying to teach someone (somewhere between the way you would talk to your friend and the way you would talk to a judge at court - the best example would be trying to tell someone about the thing you love the most, but they have zero experience around it, but you love it so much you want to make sure they understand without sounding pushy, patronising or apathetic)
3. Once you're confident with the information, and are confident with telling people about it, make it a little bit more "polished". During this stage we can make some areas "over-polished" or "under-polished" - whichever helps rely the information better. AGAIN ! Never forget we are trying to teach/share information as our main goal.
4. "Under-polishing" would be to used more common terms to describe something that not everyone may know. So instead of saying "We live in a multi-cultural area", you can add "that means that nobody ever really knows what time 'you should've been in bed by' really is"
5. "Over-polishing" would be using over-descriptive words to explain something ALMOST everyone should know. The ALMOST is important, because this allows you to explain something to someone that they may be embarressed to ask about. When over-explaining it, that person would also be able to laugh along with the joke as it is clear what was meant. An example is : "In my country... or in our nation... are they the same thing ? I seem them used interchangeably a lot a just assumed they were, but could never be bothered to find out. Well this is what I found out - just so I didn't have to pretend to know like everyone else..... [pause]....right ?"

   _Explanation being (if time available this gives a chance for under-polishing obvious parts) "A country refers to a distinct territory with defined borders and a government, often considered a state. A nation is a group of people who share a common identity, such as culture, language, or history, and don't necessarily need to reside in a specific geographic area. It's like my family all live in the same building, but there's only a sub-group of that house's citizens that agree that farts are funny, they're the nation of fart-appreciatists but we all live in the house owned by the fart-denialist"_
